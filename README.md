_Producing visualizations is an important for exploring and analyzing real-world data sets. Visualization is an indispensable method in any data scientist's toolbox. In this Project we will employ the statistical data visualization library, Seaborn, to discover and explore the relationships in the __Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set__ &  Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations to identify and interpret inherent relationships in the data set, produce various chart types including histograms, violin plots, box plots, joint plots, pair grids, and heatmaps, customize plot aesthetics and apply faceting methods to visualize higher dimensional data._
